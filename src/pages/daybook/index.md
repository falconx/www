With users having such a broad range of disabilities to consider, several revisions of the UI/UX were developed. It was important that the amount of interactions possible on a screen was heavily restricted, call to actions were clear and that actions provided useful and appropriate feedback to the user.

By learning some Adobe Illustrator basics, I was able to design a logo, icons for topics, feelings and entry type.
