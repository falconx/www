Most of my working life has been spent on the Allegiant project.

Based in Las Vegas, Allegiant Air are the ninth-largest commercial airline in the US.

I've gone from working for them as Drupal CMS engineer building UI with a JavaScript based MVC framework (JMVC) to finally using a modern JavaScript stack which includes ES6, Webpack, GraphQL and React.
